README for university Faculty and Department Web Scraper 🌐
Project Description 📝

This Python script is designed to scrape faculty and department information from the Ain Shams University (uni) website. It specifically targets faculty pages to extract data about their scientific, clinical, and administrative departments.
How it Works 🔍

    Fetching Page Content: The script uses requests to fetch HTML content from specified URLs.
    Parsing HTML: BeautifulSoup from the bs4 library is utilized to parse HTML and extract relevant data.
    Data Extraction: Specific faculty and department URLs are processed to scrape department names.
    Data Storage: Extracted data is saved into CSV files for each faculty.

Script Analysis 📊
get_soup(url)

    Fetches and returns a BeautifulSoup object for a given URL.
    Handles network requests and potential errors.

Faculty and Department URLs

    Directly lists specific URLs for each faculty and their departments, bypassing the need for dynamic scraping from the main page.

scrape_departments(department_url)

    Scrapes department names from a given department URL.
    Adjustments may be needed based on the specific HTML structure of the department pages.

save_to_csv(filename, data)

    Saves extracted data into CSV files.
    Facilitates data storage and later usage.

Main Execution

    Iterates through the faculty URLs and scrapes data from each department link.
    Implements error handling to manage potential scraping issues.

Installation and Usage 💻

    Install Required Libraries:

    bash

    pip install requests beautifulsoup4

    Running the Script:
        Execute the script in a Python environment.
        Ensure network connectivity to access the URLs.
